JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive features on websites, such as dynamic content updates, animations, and user interactions. JavaScript runs in web browsers, supported by engines like Chrome’s V8, and can also be used server-side with Node.js. It’s event-driven, single-threaded, and supports asynchronous programming with Promises, async/await, and callbacks. Modern JavaScript includes features like ES6 syntax (arrow functions, classes, modules). It interacts with the DOM (Document Object Model) to manipulate HTML and CSS. With frameworks like React, Vue, and libraries like jQuery, JavaScript has become essential for creating rich, responsive web applications.
